Here you can practice to earn how to use the `trajalign`.

To lear how to use the **trajectory class** go to the [trajectory class example](Trajectory-class-example). 

To lear how to **average trajectories** belonging to the same experiment together go to the [average trajectories example](Example-of-trajectory-average). Through this example you will be able to produce [this plot](images/plot.png):

*The inward movement of the endocytic coat protein Sla1 during endocytosis. 67 independet  trajectories are aligned in space and time and averaged together, with `trajalign` module distribution. Generate this plot by following this [example](wiki/Averaging-trajectories-example).* 

To lear how to **align the average trajectories**  together go to the [align average trajectories example](Example-of-trajectory-alignment). Through this example you will align the average trajectories of the endocytic proteins Sla1, Abp1 and Rvs167 in [this plot](images/plot_aligned_trajectories.png):

*The inward movement and the fluorescence intensity profile of the endocytic coat protein Sla1, the N-BAR protein Rvs167, and the actin binding protein Abp1.*
