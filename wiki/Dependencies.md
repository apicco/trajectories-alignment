`trajectories-alignment` uses exclusively [Python 3.X](https://docs.python.org/3/). In addition, you should install the following libraries:

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) fundamental library for scientific computing;
* [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) Scikit machine learning library.

`trajectories-alignment` uses also the following libraries that should be present as defaults in normal python installations:

* [math](https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html),
* [os](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html),
* [copy](https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html),
* [warnings](https://docs.python.org/2/library/warnings.html).

To plot the trajectories of the examples we use [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). However, this library is not necessary to use trajectories-alignment functionalities.
