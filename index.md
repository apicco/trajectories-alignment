Welcome to the `trajalign` module distribution homepage! 
`trajalign` is a collection of Python modules that align in space and in time, and average, trajectories of diffraction limited object, which are recorded with fluorescence microscopy.

![example](images/plot.png)
*The inward movement of the endocytic coat protein Sla1 during endocytosis. 67 independet  trajectories are aligned in space and time and averaged together, with `trajalign` module distribution. To generate this plot follow this [example](wiki/Averaging-trajectories-example).* 

You can [**Download**](https://github.com/apicco/trajectory_alignment/archive/master.zip) the software or visit the [github repository](https://github.com/apicco/trajectory_alignment/).

Read the [documentation](wiki/Home) to [install](wiki/Installation) and use the package.
