The `trajalign` module distribution is designed to align in space and in time the trajectories of diffraction limited objects, which are imaged in living cells with fluorescence microscopy.

The original version of the software was developed in [R](www.cran.org) and is no longer mantained. It was used to visualise the dynamic architecture of the endocytic machineries in yeast cells ([Picco, _et al._, eLife 2015](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04535)) and to resolve subtle phenotypes induced by genetic mutations in the yeast cell ([Kukulski, Picco, _et al._, eLife 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16036))

The software was developped and is currently mantained by Kaksonen [laboratory](http://cms.unige.ch/sciences/biochimie/-Marko-Kaksonen-.html).
